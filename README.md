# ai-git-tool

Use AI to read the diff and return a descriptive commit message

Should work fine on Linux and Mac

Currently needs OpenAI key

Update: i would recommend using Claude Code or other such cli tool for bettee results. I wrote about it [here](https://harishgarg.com/using-claude-code-to-write-better-git-commit-messages?showSharer=true)
